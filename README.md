## Code Update 🚀
We are releasing a cleaner code for ESD with diffusers support. Compared to our old-code this version uses almost half the GPU memory and is 5-8 times faster. The training entrypoints for SD, SDXL, and FLUX now share the same core logic, save metadata-aware checkpoints, and can target any compatible base model in the corresponding diffusers family via `--basemodel_id`. <br>

To use the older version please visit our [older commit](https://github.com/rohitgandikota/erasing/tree/a2189e9ae677aca22a00c361bde25d3d320d8a61)

## Installation Guide
We recently updated our codebase to be much more cleaner and faster. The setup is also simple
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohitgandikota/erasing.git
cd erasing
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

for FLUX training:

```bash
pip install --upgrade diffusers transformers torch
```

## Training Guide

### SDv1.4
After installation, follow these instructions to train a custom ESD model for Stable Diffusion V1.x. Canonical train methods are `'esd-x'`, `'esd-u'`, `'selfattn'`, `'esd-all'`, and `'esd-x-strict'`. Legacy aliases such as `'xattn'`, `'noxattn'`, and `'full'` still work.
```python
python esd_sd.py --erase_concept 'Van Gogh' --train_method 'esd-x'
```

💡 New application: You can now erase an attribute from a concept!! Instead of erasing a whole concept you can just precisely remove some of its attributes. For example, you can erase hats from cowboys but keep the rest intact!
```python
python esd_sd.py --erase_concept 'cowboy hat' --erase_from 'cowboy' --train_method 'esd-x'
```

### SDXL
After installation, follow these instructions to train a custom ESD model for SDXL. Pick from following `'esd-x'`, `'esd-x-strict'`, `'esd-u'`, `'esd-all'` (NOTE: `'esd-u'` and `'esd-all'` are still experimental and might produce unexpected artifacts):
```python
python esd_sdxl.py --erase_concept 'Van Gogh' --train_method 'esd-x-strict'
```

### FLUX
After installation (make sure: diffusers and transformers are up-to-date), follow these instructions to train a custom ESD model for FLUX.1-dev. Pick from following `'esd-x'`, `'esd-x-strict'`:
```python
python esd_flux.py --erase_concept 'monster' --train_method 'esd-x' --negative_guidance 2
```

### FLUX.2 Klein
FLUX.2 Klein uses the newer `Flux2KleinPipeline` backbone, so make sure your `diffusers` and `transformers` installs are recent enough for FLUX.2 support. The default base model is `black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-base-4B`, and the new entrypoint keeps the same ESD loss while following the Klein tokenizer / transformer / scheduler flow:
```python
python esd_flux2_klein.py --erase_concept 'monster' --train_method 'esd-x' --negative_guidance 2
```

All four training scripts also accept `--basemodel_id` so you can point them at any compatible diffusers model in that family.

The optimization process for erasing undesired visual concepts from pre-trained diffusion model weights involves using a short text description of the concept as guidance. The ESD model is fine-tuned with the conditioned and unconditioned scores obtained from frozen SD model to guide the output away from the concept being erased. The model learns from it's own knowledge to steer the diffusion process away from the undesired concept.

## Generating Images

Generating images from a custom ESD model is super easy. Please follow the notebooks in `notebooks/`.

For an automated script to generate a ton of images for your evaluations use our evalscripts. The loader now auto-detects whether a checkpoint targets `unet` or `transformer`, so the same script works for SD, SDXL, and FLUX checkpoints.
```python
python evalscripts/generate-images.py --base_model 'stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0' --esd_path 'esd-models/sdxl/esd-kelly-from-kelly.safetensors' --num_samples 1 --prompts_path 'data/kelly_prompts.csv' --num_inference_steps 20 --guidance_scale 7
```
